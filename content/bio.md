I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/) and [Prof. Yuhui Shi](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/shiyuhui.html) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). During my Ph.D. studies, I have closely collaborated with [Dr. Pichao Wang](https://wangpichao.github.io/) from NVIDIA.

I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from SUSTech in 2021, where I graduated in the top 10% of my class. I was also an exchange student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2020).

My current research focuses on **Text-to-Video Generation**, **Video Editing**, and **3D Vision**, with a particular emphasis on diffusion models and their applications in visual content generation and manipulation.

[I am currently actively seeking internship and full-time positions starting in 2026.]()
